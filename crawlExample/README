Title: Sample Web crawl
Author: Stewart Grant

This directory is a sample for assignment 5. This example is composed of two
web servers which run on two separate machines. The structure of directory machine 1 is as follows.

machine1
machine1/server.go
machine1/index.html
machine1/a/index.html
machine1/b/index.html

Machine2 is structured as follows

machine2
machine2/server.go
machine2/index.html
machine2/c/index.html

To imitate the server on any machine go to the main directory of the machine and run the following command

`go run server.go [publicIP]`

note that no port number is needed the default is 8080. If you are running this
on Azure then the ip is the public ip. If you are testing on your local machine
then just use localhost.

The index.html files form a directed graph
machine1/index.html --> machine1/a/index.html
machine1/index.html --> machine1/b/index.html
machine1/index.html --> machine2/index.html ##########Remote link######This is the one you need to edit in the next step I don't know your ip
machine1/index.html --> wantonsolutions.github.io ## my site

machine1/a/index.html --> machine1/b/index.html

machine2/index.html --> machine2/c/index.html

###IMPORTANT##### I don't know where your machines live so the link from one
website to the other needs to be done manually. To do this go into
machine1/index.html and edit the link that I have marked to point to the vm or
machine which is running machine 2.
