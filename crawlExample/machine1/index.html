Title: Sample Web crawl <br>
Author: Stewart Grant <br><br>

This directory is a sample for assignment 5. This example is composed of two
web servers which run on two separate machines. The structure of directory
machine 1 is as follows. <br><br>
<hr>
machine1
<br>
machine1/server.go
<br>
machine1/index.html
<br>
machine1/a/index.html
<br>
machine1/b/index.html
<br>

<hr>
Machine2 is structured as follows
<br>
<br>

machine2
<br>
machine2/server.go
<br>
machine2/index.html
<br>
machine2/c/index.html
<hr>

To imitate the server on any machine go to the main directory of the machine and run the following command <br><br>

<b>go run server.go [publicIP]</b>
        
<br>
<br>

You will need to run this on both machines. Note that no port number is needed the default is 8080. If you are running
this on Azure then the ip is the public ip. If you are testing on your local
machine then just use localhost.
<hr>

The index.html files form a directed graph
<br>
<br>
machine1/index.html --> machine1/a/index.html
<br>
machine1/index.html --> machine1/b/index.html
<br>
machine1/index.html --> machine2/index.html <b>Remote link</b> you have to modify this 
<br>
machine1/index.html --> wantonsolutions.github.io
<br>

machine1/a/index.html --> machine1/b/index.html
<hr>

machine2/index.html --> machine2/c/index.html
<br>
<hr>

<b>IMPORTANT</b> <p>I don't know where your machines live so the link from one
website to the other needs to be done manually. To do this go into
machine1/index.html and edit the link that I have marked to point to the vm or
machine which is running machine 2.</p>
